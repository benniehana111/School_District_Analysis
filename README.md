# School District Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

This analysis provides insights into the relationships between student performance on math and reading examinations and school attributes including school type, school size, and spending per student. 

## Analysis of School District Metrics

The python code provided for this exercise for creating a school data summary would not run on my computer, although though it worked properly on the TA's system. Because of this problem, I had to create the summary table by printing the individual per school results from the code, then cutting and pasting the output into the Per_School_Summary_DataFrame excel sheet included here.

The school district metrics were only marginally affected by the removal of Thomas High School 9th grade results. The change in Thomas High School overall results is provided below.

## Summary

The deletion of Thomas High School 9th grade results affected the summary results as follows:

  1. Average math scores declined slightly from 83.42 to 83.35.
  2. Average reading scores increased slightly from 83.49 to 83.90.
  3. The percentage of students passing math declined slightly from 93.27% to 93.19%.
  4. The percentage of students passing reading increased slightly from 97.31% to 97.19%.
